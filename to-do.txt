-- WHAT'S LEFT TO DO --
1. csim.c compiles and reads values from the tracefile, however misses, hits and evictions are not being properly done
    a. 2D array traversal through pointer arithmetic should be working fine, however will need testing with hardcoded values to see why it isn't
    b. One of my assumptions are that the tag isn't being properly done, resulting in skewed hits/miss/evict counts

2. trans.c seems to be not functioning at all when running test-trans
    a. Also need to make sure that the given transpose functions actually provide good results
